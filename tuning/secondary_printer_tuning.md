# Secondary Printer Tuning

Tuning steps and processes after everything is working.

## Gantry Racking & Squaring

**V2:** Check out [Ellis' gantry squaring guide](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Print-Tuning-Guide/blob/main/articles/voron_v2_gantry_squaring.md).

**All Printers:** Check out [Nero's video on gantry racking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOn6u9kXvy0).

## Belt Tension

Belts that are too tight (or too loose) can cause mechanical issues, premature wear and print quality issues.


### A/B Belts
**Watch [this video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54855101/163674612-930d737d-0ab3-4056-a2b9-def2939db61f.mp4) for a demonstration.**
1. Move your X extrusion forwards until the X/Y idler centers are 150mm from the front idler centers.
2. Pluck the 150mm section of belt and measure the frequency with one of the apps listed below.
3. Adjust the tensions until the lowest frequency in your plot registers approximately 110Hz.
    - The A/B belt tensions can affect each other. Tightening one will also tighten the other. Go back and forth adjusting each until they are equal.
4. Move your X extrusion back at least a few centimeters and then back again. Re-check your tensions.

110hz equals roughly 2lb of belt tension here, which is on the lower end of the range. This should be a good starting point without stretching your belts too tight.

### Z Belts (Voron V2)
A good starting point is 140hz. You will follow a similar process. 
1. Move the gantry upwards until the fixed side of the belt is 150mm from the Z idler centers.
2. Pluck, measure, and adjust, same as above.
3. Move your gantry down at least a few centimeters and then back up again. Re-check your tensions.

### Apps
- iOS: Sound Spectrum Analysis
- Android: Spectroid
- Both: Gates Carbon Drive *(use the "motorcycle" option)*
    - This app shows a single frequency rather than a graph. It's more difficult to get a good reading, but easier to interpret the result.

## Bed Mesh (Switchwire)
Due to the the use of a thinner bed on the switchwire, a bed mesh is usually needed.

The mesh settings in the stock configs are usually fine. However, if you do wish to fine tune it, detailed information can be found [in the Klipper docs](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/Bed_Mesh.md). 

Note that unlike other Voron models, the Switchwire uses the probe as a virtual endstop, and thus should **NOT** use `relative_reference_index`.

It is important to check that your probe is correctly calibrated using `PROBE_CALIBRATE`.

To run a mesh, you should place `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` in your `PRINT_START` macro after G28 (and after bed heating).

## Bed Mesh (Legacy, Trident, 2.4)

Larger printers are more likely to need a bed mesh.

While the thick beds themselves are usually quite flat, your gantry and frame will expand and warp a bit with chamber heat.\
The extrusions with linear rails will actually [bend slightly when heated](./images/bimetallic_flex.png) due to differing rates of thermal expansion.

This often requires a bed mesh to compensate.

Because your mesh can change at different bed, chamber, and frame temperatures, it is generally recommended to generate a mesh before every print rather than using saved meshes.

### Setup

The `[bed_mesh]` configuration options can be found [in the Klipper docs](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/Bed_Mesh.md) described in detail.

Here is a sample configuration. You can copy & paste this into your `printer.cfg`, making sure to uncomment the appropriate `mesh_min` and `mesh_max` for your bed size.
```python
[bed_mesh]
speed: 300
horizontal_move_z: 10
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
##	Uncomment below for 250mm build
#mesh_min: 40, 40
#mesh_max: 210,210

##	Uncomment for 300mm build
#mesh_min: 40, 40
#mesh_max: 260,260

##	Uncomment for 350mm build
#mesh_min: 40, 40
#mesh_max: 310,310
##--------------------------------------------------------------------
fade_start: 0.6
fade_end: 10.0
probe_count: 5,5 # Values should be odd, so one point is directly at bed center
algorithm: bicubic
relative_reference_index: 12 # Update when changing probe_count, to ((x points * y points) - 1) / 2. (the center point)
```

Then, place `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` in your `PRINT_START` macro, **AFTER** any homing and leveling routines like `G28`, `G32`, `QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL`, and `Z_TILT_ADJUST`.\
This will generate a mesh before every print.

### Mesh Points

Generally a 5x5 grid is acceptable for even the largest Voron printer, but you can adjust the points as you see fit.

It is recommended to use **odd** values for numbers of points in X and Y, *(such as 3x3, 5x5, or 7x7)*, so that there is always a probe point directly in the center of your bed. 

### Relative Reference Index (!)

As we use the probe as a relative and not absolute measurement device, **it is critical that you have the `relative_reference_index` parameter. This value will change as you adjust your mesh size.**

`relative_reference_index` = ((x points * y points) - 1) / 2

- 3x3 mesh = 4
- 5x5 mesh = 12
- 7x7 mesh = 24 
- (etc)

#### Verification

You should check your mesh preview in Mainsail / Fluidd before printing.

- The left image shows a **correctly** configured mesh. It is located around Z0.

- The right image shows an **incorrect** mesh config. This is what it looks like when your `relative_reference_index` is not set.

## Input Shaper

Input Shaper is a Klipper-specific software technique for reducing ringing (also known as echoing, ghosting or rippling) in prints.  See the Klipper guide on [configuring Input Shaper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/Resonance_Compensation.md) for more details and the complete process.

## Print Tuning

Andrew Ellis' [Print Tuning Guide](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Print-Tuning-Guide) goes into more detail about print tuning.

It covers topics like build surface adhesion, first layer, pressure advance calibration, extrusion multiplier calibration, cooling, and retraction â€” along with some more advanced topics and troubleshooting pages.
